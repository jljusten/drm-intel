I915 DG2 RFC Section

Upstream plan
=============
Plan to upstream the DG2 enabling is:

* Merge basic HW enabling for DG2 (Still without pciid)
* Merge the 64k support for lmem
* Merge the flat CCS enabling patches
* Add the pciid for DG2 and enable the DG2 in CI


64K page support for lmem
=========================
On DG2 hw, local-memory supports minimum GTT page size of 64k only. 4k is not
supported anymore.

DG2 hw doesn't support the 64k (lmem) and 4k (smem) pages in the same ppgtt
Page table. Refer the struct drm_i915_gem_create_ext for the implication of
handling the 64k page size.
